## Shitty youtube downloader that downloads a video from youtube supported by pytube

### created by Loopy aka me

- make sure to have a videos folder for the files to go too 
- make sure you have pytube installed if not do `pip install pytube`  then just run the main.py file
- have fun better than those weird sites on google
